Performance Metrics to Track:
To fairly evaluate and compare the search algorithms (BFS, A*, and Hill Climbing), the following performance metrics were measured:
1. Time Complexity (Wall-clock Execution Time):
This metric measures the actual time taken by the algorithm to find a solution, from the start state until the goal is reached or failure is declared.
It reflects how fast the algorithm performs in practice on the given maze.
* BFS: Slower due to exhaustive level-by-level exploration.
* A*: Faster due to heuristic guidance toward the goal.
* Hill Climbing: Usually very fast, but may terminate early without finding a solution.

2. Space Complexity (Peak Memory Usage):
This represents the maximum amount of memory consumed during execution.
* BFS: High memory usage because it stores all frontier nodes in a queue.
* A*: High memory usage due to maintaining open and closed lists.
* Hill Climbing: Very low memory usage since it stores only the current state.

3. Solution Quality (Optimality of the Solution):
This metric evaluates whether the algorithm guarantees the shortest path.
* BFS: Always finds the optimal (shortest) path.
* A*: Finds the optimal path if the heuristic is admissible.
* Hill Climbing: Does not guarantee optimality.

4. Nodes Explored:
This metric counts the total number of nodes expanded during the search process.
* BFS: Explores a large number of nodes.
* A*: Explores fewer nodes due to heuristic pruning.
* Hill Climbing: Explores very few nodes but risks getting stuck.

5. Path Cost:
The total cost of the final path from the start node to the goal node.
* BFS: Minimum path cost (assuming uniform step cost).
* A*: Minimum path cost when heuristic is admissible.
* Hill Climbing: Path cost may be higher than optimal.

Visualization Recommendations:

To better understand and analyze the behavior of the algorithms, the following visualizations are recommended:

1. Search Tree / Graph Visualization
Display the order in which nodes are explored to illustrate how each algorithm navigates the maze.

2. Solution Path Animation
Animate the final path from the start to the goal to clearly show the efficiency and direction of each algorithm.

3. Performance Comparison Charts
Use bar charts or tables to compare:
* Execution time
* Number of nodes explored
* Path cost
This helps highlight performance differences between BFS, A*, and Hill Climbing.

4. Heatmaps
Generate heatmaps showing how frequently nodes are visited.
This visualization reveals:
* Areas of heavy exploration
* Algorithm efficiency across different maze sizes and complexities
